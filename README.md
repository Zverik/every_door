# Every Door

The best mobile editor for adding shops and amenities to OpenStreetMap.

Help test it for [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/every-door/id1621945342) and
Android ([F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/info.zverev.ilya.every_door/), [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=info.zverev.ilya.every_door), [GitHub](https://github.com/Zverik/every_door/releases/latest)).

The roadmap is in [a project](https://github.com/users/Zverik/projects/1/views/2).

## Presets and Translations

The editor uses [presets from iD](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema):
they are managed in a dedicated repository and translated on [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/openstreetmap/id-editor/translate/#ru/presets/).

To translate value options, first make a pull request to the iD tagging repo
adding desired options, [like here](https://github.com/openstreetmap/id-tagging-schema/blob/main/data/fields/camera/type.json).
Then, when the translation source on Transifex is updated, there will be strings to translate.
[Like here](https://www.transifex.com/openstreetmap/id-editor/translate/#ru/presets/101711314?q=key%3Apresets.fields.camera%2Ftype).

Brands are managed in the [Name Suggestion Index](https://github.com/osmlab/name-suggestion-index).

Help translate the app at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/every-door/app/). I'm grateful
to them for a libre hosting.

## Design

I need help with design. That includes [a new icon](https://github.com/Zverik/every_door/tree/main/icon),
[the website](https://github.com/Zverik/everydoor-website), Flutter animations for everything,
and general UX improvements. Please help.

### Principles

1. ED displays and edits only tagged nodes and polygons represented with their centerpoints. No roads.
2. ED focuses on surveying: adding and detailing things that you can see around you. Not map maintenance.
3. Fewer buttons and menus: heuristic is preferable to a setting, and every button benefits the surveyor.

## How To Build

You will need the [Flutter SDK](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/tools/sdk/overview) installed.
Alternatively, clone with submodules (`git clone --recursive`) and use `vendor/flutter/bin/flutter`. That
is the preferred way for releases.

1. Download [taginfo-db.db](https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/download) and unpack it somewhere (it's ~9 GB).
2. From the `tools` directory, run `./update.sh <path_to_taginfo_db>`.
    * Alternatively, do `curl https://textual.ru/presets.db -o assets/presets.db`
3. `echo '{}' > lib/l10n/app_zh.arb (fixing Dart's localization issues).
4. `flutter pub get`.
5. `flutter build`.
